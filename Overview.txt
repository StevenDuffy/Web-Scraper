I have created two ASP.NET MVC web applications. The first is a more simplified version, while the second located in WebScraperApp_Two has a business layer to decouple business logic from the application.

New search engines can be added to the application by adding their details to the SearchEngine app setting located in web.config. The string must be in the format:

,SearchEngineName:BaseURL:SelectorText:SelectorType 

Where SelectorType may be either CSS or XPATH.

Languages/Tech used:

C#, XML, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, AJAX, Selenium (Web Driver).

'Required' validation has been added to the search term field. Once a search term is entered, a search will be performed in all configured search engines via Chrome browser. A table is then presented to the user with the results in which the search term is highlighted where it appears. 

Additional note:

The Chrome browser currently shows the search being performed to evidence the search actions, however, a snippet of code can be uncommented in the WebScraper.cs class to enable an option that hides the Chrome browser.
